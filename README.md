# 🚀 Project In Progress: SmartStuff Tracker 📦

**Hello!**

Welcome to the **SmartStuff Tracker** project! 🌟 This project is a work in progress, but I'm excited about the journey ahead. 

## 🌟 Project Goals

My goal is to create an easy-to-use and ergonomic Progressive Web App (PWA) using Next.js that helps you keep track of various items, from food in your fridge to tools in your garage. 

## ✨ Features in the Pipeline

I'm planning to implement some awesome features, including:
- Barcode scanning for product management 📷
- User-friendly interface and seamless navigation 🎨
- Intuitive item categorization and tracking 📝

## 🛠️ Work in Progress

While this project is still under construction, I'm putting my heart and soul into it to make it great! Stay tuned for updates and improvements.

Feel free to reach out, contribute, or offer suggestions. Together, we'll build something amazing! 🛠️💡

Let's make everyday organization effortless and fun! 🏠🔍🧰



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/index.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
